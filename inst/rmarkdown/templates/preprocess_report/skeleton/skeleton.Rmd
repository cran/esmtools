<!--------- INSTRUCTIONS ----------
This template would help you to structure and share your preprocessing. 
It is based on the ESM preprocessing framework described in Revol and al. (under review) 
In addition, it is associated with an R package, the esmtools package (https://package.esmtools.com), 
and a website to provide tutorials and R code for each step: https://preprocess.esmtools.com.
Please, follow the instructions commented and add descriptions above each chunk you create. 
that mainly use esmtools functions (e.g., buttons) to enhanced user experience. 
Note that the commented instructions are not displayed in the rendered document. 
<!--------------------------------->


<!-- The following CSS code set up the font that is used to highlight elements in the file (issues and Modifications). -->
<!-- You can adapt it if you want another font type, color, etc. -->
<style>
/* Highligh issue text */
#text_issue{
    font-weight: bold;
    color:#e61919;
    text-decoration: underline #e61919 2px;

<!-- This first chunk define the global settings and hidden variables of the file. -->
```{r, include=FALSE}
# Setup hiden variables

# Setup settings

This template follows the preprocessing framework described in Revol and al. (under review) and can be found in a R package [esmbooks](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/ppw-okpiv/researchers/u0148925/esmbooks). 





# Study and data collection procedure
<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
In this section, describe the design and the sampling scheme used to collect the data.
It will be later useful when investigating the data. 
-->


# Import

<!-- INSTRUCTION: before or after each chunk, please add a short description of what is done/displayed, as follows: -->

Import the packages:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# For instance:
library(ggplot2) # Used to create plots
```

Import the data:
```{r}
data = read.csv("path_to_file.csv")
```


# Step 1: Getting to know your data and initial preprocessing

This section is dedicated to the first look at the data, the first basic preprocessing methods, and checking the variable consistency when the data has just been imported.


<!-- INSTRUCTIONS: the HTML code below (span tags) helps to highlight the important information in the document. -->
<!-- In particular, the issues discovered and the modifications done to the dataset. -->
<!-- Note that it must be used for each step (not only this first one). -->


<!-- Whenever you have spotted an issue give it a name and add a description. -->
<!-- To highlight the issues in a consistent way, start as follows -->
<span id="text_issue"> Issue `r er=er+1 ; er`:</span> DESCRIPTION

```{r}

```


<!-- Whenever you have spotted an issue, it may be convenient to further support it by displaying the problematic rows themselves. -->
<!-- Indeed, functions and plots may sometimes be misleading about potential issues.  -->
<!-- To highlight the data inspection in a consistent way, start as follows -->
<span id="text_inspect"> Data inspection:</span> DESCRIPTION

```{r}

```


<!-- Whenever you modify the dataset, report it and explain exactly what has been modified. -->
<!-- To highlight the data modifications in a consistent way, start as follows -->
<span id="text_modif"> Data modification: </span> DESCRIPTION

```{r}

```





# Step 2: Design and sample scheme checking

This section is dedicated to checking and solving issues due to inconsistencies between the planned and the actual design of the study.

```{r}

```






# Step 3: Participants response behaviors

This section is dedicated to investigating how well participants engaged with the ESM study looking particularly for problematic patterns of behaviors (e.g., invalid observations, response time, careless responding).


```{r}

```






# Step 4: Compute and transform variables

This section is dedicated to computing and modifying variables of interest that will later be used in visualization and statistical analysis.

```{r}

```




# Step 5: Descriptive statistics and visualization

This section is dedicated to examining various aspects of variables (such as distribution) and the differences both within and between participants.





# Export preprocessed data

The preprocessed data is finally exported.

```{r}

```






# Session info

For reproducibility purposes, this section informs about the R session and packages used as well as their versions.

<!-- 
Session info includes information such as R environment and package versions used, which ensures reproducibility.
Dataset info includes information that ensures traceability and reproducibility (e.g., checksum, size, dimensions, date of modification). 
-->
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Additionally, we display the meta-information of the preprocessed dataset. 

```{r}
esmtools::dataInfo(file_path=file_path_preproc, 
                   read_fun = read.csv,
                   idvar="id", timevar="sent")
```
